# Association of Suicide Rate with Mental Health Care
# Suicide is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts require coordination and 
# collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors 
# such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defense, politics, and the media.
# These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated as no single approach alone can make an impact on an issue as complex as suicide.
# This analysis is trying to discover the association between the availability of workforce, human resources in mental health care sector with the suicide rate in the countries.

# ========= Import the packages =========
import os
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import sys

# Importing Customised Common Data Reader Class

# ========= Getting Data =========

# Use common Data Reader Class to load data
data_reader = SuicideDataReader()

# Load Suicide Rate data
suicide_rate_data = data_reader.read_data(SuicideProcessedData.SUICIDE_RATES)
# print(suicide_rate_data)

# Load Human Resource data
hr_data = data_reader.read_data(SuicideRawData.HUMAN_RESOURCES)
#print(hr_dataframe.head())

# ========= Prepare Data =========

# Filter the suicide rate data for 
suicide_rate_dataframe = suicide_rate_data[suicide_rate_data["sex"] != "Both sexes"][["country", "all_age", "sex"]]

# Merge the two dataframes for plotting purpose
merged_dataframe = pd.merge(suicide_rate_dataframe, hr_data, on="country")
#print(merged_dataframe.head())

# ========= Plotting (1) =========
#Plotting to to visualise the association between Suicide rate of All age and Psychiatrists

# setting style
